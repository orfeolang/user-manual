# The Dataline File Format

<br>

> [!Version]
> __0.1.0__

## Introduction

The Dataline file format is for storing data on a temporal, spatial, or other
kind of numerically divided line, e.g., a timeline divided in seconds, a spatial
line divided in metres, a mass line divided in kilograms.

It is a simple open-source plaintext human readable and editable file format
with Unicode support.

Although designed as the compilation target for the Orfeo programming language,
Dataline is a flexible meta file format that can serve a wide range of other
uses since its measurement unit and data type are abstract and left for
applications to specify.

## Extension

Dataline files should use the `.dataline` extension.

## Syntax

Dataline's syntax is composed of two word types called a location and a datum,
and one phrase type â€” made from those words â€” called a point.

### Location

A location indicates a position in time, space, or any other numerical sequence
like a collection of masses. It is left for applications to specify which
measurement unit should be represented by locations, e.g., seconds, minutes,
hours, years, centimetres, metres, kilograms.

A location is a nonnegative number, i.e., an integer or a float with a value of
zero or more. Leading zeros are not permitted.

Following are five valid locations:

```
0
.203
0.666
1.014
12
```

### Datum

A datum is a piece of data.

It may represent any kind of information and be of any length. All Unicode
characters are supported except for vertical whitespaces, i.e. a datum cannot be
multi-line. The first and last characters must be non-whitespace characters;
horizontal whitespaces may be used everywhere else. In the event of an
application requiring a datum padded by whitespaces, a quoting character should
be used to encapsulate it.

Following are five valid datums:

```
415Hz
Bâ™­4
ðŸŽº + ðŸŽ· = horns
This sentence is one datum
"     This datum is padded by whitespaces     "
```

> [!WARNING]
> The definition of a datum in Orfeo is much more restrictive than in Dataline.

### Point

A point consists of a location optionally followed by horizontal whitespace and
a datum.

Following are three valid points:

```dataline
0
1.014 415Hz
12    ðŸŽº + ðŸŽ· = horns
```

## Grammar

Dataline files are made from none, one, or many points which must be organized
by location in ascending or descending order with allowed repetitions. Each
point must be on its own line and may optionally be padded by horizontal
whitespace. Empty lines are permitted.

### Symbol Guide

Following is a symbol guide for the Point Layouts and EBNF sections below:

```guide
? = zero or one
* = zero or more
+ = one or more
| = logical OR
( = group start
) = group end

<hws>   = horizontal whitespace
<nonws> = non-whitespace
```

### Point Layouts

Following are all eight possible point layouts:

```
<location>
<location> <hws>+
<hws>+ <location>
<hws>+ <location> <hws>+
<location> <hws>+ <datum>
<location> <hws>+ <datum> <hws>+
<hws>+ <location> <hws>+ <datum>
<hws>+ <location> <hws>+ <datum> <hws>+
```

### EBNF

Following is a custom Extended Backus-Naur Form for Dataline:

```EBNF
<Dataline_v0.1.0>  = <line>*
<line>             = <hws>* <point>? <hws>* <newline>
<point>            = <location> (<hws>+ <datum>)?
<location>         = <nonnegative-int> | <nonnegative-real>
<nonnegative-int>  = <zero> | <positive-int>
<nonnegative-real> = (<nonnegative-int> <period> <digit>*) |
                     (<period> <digit>+)
<positive-int>     = <nonzero-digit> <digit>*
<digit>            = <zero> | <nonzero-digit>
<datum>            = <word> (<hws>+ <word>)*
<word>             = <nonws>+
<newline>          = \n
<hws>              = \h
<nonws>            = \S
<zero>             = 0
<nonzero-digit>    = [1-9]
<period>           = .
```

## Examples

> [!NOTE]
> Commenting will be added in Dataline v0.2.0  
> For now, comments are presented in the form of a point with a datum prefixed
> by `#`

### To the Underworld!

```dataline
0 # Orpheus Ventures to the Underworld
0 # Locations represent seconds

  1 Sounds of birds and rustling leaves whistle in the air.
  5 Orpheus walks the forest in search of his love Eurydice.
 20 Upon finding her dead, he sings a melody of mourning.
 50 Orpheus walks the forest towards the Underworld.
 65 He sings a melody to charm the ferryman Charron.
 95 Sounds of oars pushing through water mark the crossing of the Styx.
110 Orpheus reaches the entrance to the Underworld.
115 He sings a melody to charm Cerberus.
145 Orpheus climbs down into the Underworld.
160 He sings a melody to charm Hades.
190 Hades revives Eurydice, but forbids Orpheus to look at her.
195 Orpheus climbs out of the Underworld and Eurydice follows.
210 Upon seeing the Sun, he turns to see her.
215 She disappears into nothingness.
